### depreciated*
Dialogflow's workflow config doesnt allow for easy looping to cover many common conversation loop use cases.
It also only returns top matching intent, which limits the post processing that can be done.


# Usage

First, configure your client in ./client/Customer.ts

```
npm i
npm run Rasa:Generate
docker compose up
```

You should be able to go to http://localhost:3000
